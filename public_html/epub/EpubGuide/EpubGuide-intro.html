<h2>Introduction</h2>

   <p>This is a guide for making IDPF Epub ebooks/publications. It is mostly an annotated example: this document itself in Epub form.</p>
   
   <p>Not all details/variations are mentioned, but enough to obviate need of the specifications for normal use. And it is for making entirely conformant publications.</p>

   <p>Included also is a description of optional extra styling for a particular reader (but still completely conformant).</p>

   <p>You need an understanding of and ability to make XHTML/CSS and XML documents.</p>

   <h3>IDPF</h3>

   <p>&lsquo;Epub&rsquo; is a standard from the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/">International Digital Publishing Forum</a>. It is an arrangement of several other standards (mainly: XHTML, CSS, XML, NCX, DCMI). There are three parts, addressing: content, package metadata, and archive (<a href="EpubGuide-specs.html">OPS, OPF, and OCF</a>). It is powerful, straightforward, and non-proprietary.</p>

   <h3>Adobe Digital Editions</h3>

   <p>&lsquo;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/">ADE</a>&rsquo; is one of the first readers for Epub publications. It is very conformant with the standard. It can use an optional proprietary publication component: an extra stylesheet to adjust text-column appearance. (That is allowed by the standard.)</p>

   <p>This guide was written using ADE version 1.0.467 .</p>
